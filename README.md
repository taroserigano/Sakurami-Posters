# Sakurami-Posters

Sakurami poster projects were built in order to advertise and push the marketing across Poland to gain more students. 
I designed the posters by using BannerSnack application. 
This digital ad was also used for advertisement on the back cover of the Torii magazin (https://torii.com.pl/).
